Interactive Content to Aid in Teaching Physics (mostly testing of features)

## Installation and Running

* There are two git submodules, one for reveal.js and one for MathJax so that the presentations can be run offline.  If you want better version control, you could use `bower` or `npm`.
* Open `test.html`.
* Copy and modify `test.html` as you like.
